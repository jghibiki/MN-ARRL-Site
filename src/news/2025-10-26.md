Well, a little over one month in and the site is still in the works, but I'm working on getting some of the backbone of the site optimized and cleaned up. I think I've got most of the things working the way I want them to, so now I can work on flushing the site out with content.

**New additions/modifications:**
- some changes to the backend of the site rendering
- Updated the "About" page
- Added the Repeaters page as a stub for now.
- Added a plugin to the site generator to generate a RSS feed for the site news.
- Updated the events page

**TODO:**
- Flush out the Repeaters page
- Flush out the Resources page
- Share the site more vocally with the community. (Currently it's live on the internet, but only a few people know about it, other than those who stumble upon it via a search engine).

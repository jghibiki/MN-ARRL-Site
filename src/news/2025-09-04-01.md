It lives! And by "it", we mean this site!

I had been planning to create a site for the MN ARRL section shortly after Bill AE0EE asked me to help out with things as the section Technical Coordinator. But with the sunset of the MinnesotaHamRadio site, we were presented with a great opportunity to help preserve a set of valuable Minnesota community resources without (hopefully) stepping on any toes. In light of that I want to thank those who helped run the Minnesota Ham Radio site. It certainly helped me early in my ham journey to find minnesota specific resources easily.

Right off the bat here the site will be a bit bare-bones, but it's my hope to be able to resurrect and refresh many of the resources that were previously hosted on the Minnesota Ham Radio site.
